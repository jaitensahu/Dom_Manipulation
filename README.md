# Dom_Manipulation

## Project Description:

This web project involves dynamic manipulation of a div element using the Document Object Model (DOM). Through JavaScript, I have enhanced the visual appearance and layout of the div by changing its color, background color, margin, padding, font size, font weight, height, and width. These interactive modifications improve the user interface and provide a more engaging and visually appealing experience for website visitors.

This is the README for the DOM manipulation. Below are instructions on how to view the hosted version of this project.
